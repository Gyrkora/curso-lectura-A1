“Hello! I’m Paloma Rodríguez. I’m 25 years old, and I’m Taiwanese and Chilean (I have both passports). I’m new to Santiago, Chile, and I’ve come from Taiwan to improve my Spanish. My father is Chilean, and I’m also here to get to know him. I’m a business engineer,” Paloma repeats over and over, looking at herself in the mirror.

It’s Monday, 6:30 AM, and Paloma is very excited and a bit anxious because she has her first job interview today. The company is called Tecnomed, a national company specializing in the trade of instruments and technology for medical laboratories. It’s located downtown. To get there, she has to take the subway and then walk about five minutes along the main avenue. While sipping her hot chocolate, she tries to review the conversation she practiced with her friend Carlota.

She knows that facing an interview in a new language and culture isn’t easy, but she’s determined to do her best. Paloma met Carlota during a Spanish course, and they’ve been good friends ever since. Carlota, a Spanish teacher, understands Paloma’s challenges and is happy to help her.

The day is hot, with a slight breeze. Just before leaving, her phone vibrates. She looks at the screen and sees her dad calling from the city of Concepción. She hesitates for a moment but decides not to answer. She doesn’t want to get distracted before the interview, so she quickly sends a message: “I’m busy right now, Dad. I’ll call you later.”

Paloma walks into a well-maintained colonial house and enters a large office with air conditioning and wooden walls. At the door, she sees a tall woman in her 40s with dark brown hair, a kind face, and a big smile.

**Interviewer**: Good morning, I’m Cecilia, Head of Human Resources at Tecnomed. You must be Paloma, right?

**Paloma**: Good morning. Yes, that’s me. Nice to meet you, Ms. Cecilia.

**Interviewer**: Nice to meet you too, Paloma. How are you?

**Paloma**: I’m great, thank you. And you?

**Interviewer**: I’m good as well, thank you. Well, Paloma, please have a seat on that chair. We’re going to ask you a few questions. I reviewed your résumé, and you have excellent academic references from Chinese and Taiwanese institutions, but you lack work experience.

Paloma feels her hands sweating, but she knows she needs to stay calm, so she takes a deep breath and sits down.

**Interviewer**: Okay, let’s start with the first question – _the interviewer prepares to write on a piece of paper on her desk_ – What’s your full name?

**Paloma**: My name is Paloma Rodríguez Lin.

**Interviewer**: Oh! Lin, are you Chilean? – _she asks with a smile, surprised._

**Paloma**: Yes, but my mother is Taiwanese, and I lived in Taiwan for many years. My dad is Chilean, but this is my first time in Chile.

**Interviewer**: So, you speak Chinese, right? And how’s your Spanish?

Paloma is surprised; perhaps being Taiwanese is an advantage. However, she feels nervous and tries to focus on answering.

**Paloma**: Yes, I speak Mandarin Chinese, and I also speak English. I’m taking Spanish classes, and my goal is to become fluent in this language.

**Interviewer**: That’s so interesting! I’d love to visit Taiwan someday. Well, we have very important Chinese partners at this company. – _The interviewer seems interested and writes something in her notebook._ – How old are you, Paloma?

**Paloma**: I’m 25 years old.

**Interviewer**: So young! – _Paloma blushes_ – And do you have children?

**Paloma**: No, I don’t have children.

**Interviewer**: Are you married?

**Paloma**: I’m not married either. I’m single. – _“And happy,” she thinks._

**Interviewer**: Where are you currently living, Paloma? – _she asks while sipping her coffee and checking the time._

**Paloma**: I live on Violeta Parra Street, very close to here.

Paloma hopes that the interview is going well and that she might get her first job. She can already imagine her mom’s happy face!

**Interviewer**: Ah, great! Perfect, because this job is hybrid. It requires being here at least three times a week; the other days, you can work from home. I see this would be your first job. Why do you want to work with us? – _she asks with a smile and a very kind look._

Paloma looks to the side, trying to recall the company’s mission. She feels nervous, and there’s an awkward 30-second silence.

**Paloma**: Um, sorry, I’m just a little nervous.

**Interviewer**: Don’t worry, dear! Take your time to think about what you want to say.

**Paloma**: Well, I’m interested in working with you because it’s an excellent opportunity to gain more experience in this field. I really like technology and healthcare. Many of my university research projects are related to these topics, and your company is very well known.

**Interviewer**: Very good, Paloma! Thank you for coming. Tomorrow, we’ll send you an email with our response.

The interviewer stands up and bids her farewell with a kiss on the cheek.

**Paloma**: Thank you! Have a great day, and thanks again.

**Interviewer**: Same to you. See you soon!

**Paloma**: Goodbye!

Paloma leaves the house and looks around. She feels motivated and even believes the fresh wind brings her good energy and opportunities. Will she get an email with a positive response?

– "I really hope so. I really want to work for this company… Chinese partners? I have so much to do here," – Paloma thinks as she closes her eyes and breathes in the city air. Cough, cough. The air is heavy and dense, not like her hometown’s, but it doesn’t matter; the capital has so much to offer.

Paloma puts on her headphones and decides to walk home, her mind full of dreams and plans for her future at Tecnomed.
